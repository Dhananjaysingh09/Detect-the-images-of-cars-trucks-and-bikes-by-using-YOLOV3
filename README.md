Overview
This project implements the YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once version 3) deep learning model for detecting and classifying images of cars, trucks, and bikes. YOLOv3 is a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm known for its speed and accuracy. The primary goal of this project is to accurately identify the presence of cars, trucks, and bikes in an image and draw bounding boxes around each detected object.

YOLOv3 Features
YOLOv3 is a single-shot object detection model, capable of detecting multiple objects in an image in a single pass.
Provides real-time object detection performance, making it suitable for various applications.
Utilizes Darknet, a deep learning framework, for training and inference.
Pre-trained weights are available for quick start or can be trained on custom datasets.
Highly accurate in identifying and localizing objects of different sizes and orientations.

Usage
Download the pre-trained YOLOv3 weights from the official YOLO website.
Place the weights file in the weights/ directory.
Use the following command to run object detection on an image: python detect.py --image path/to/image.jpg

Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the creators of YOLOv3 and the Darknet framework for their incredible work in the field of computer vision.
